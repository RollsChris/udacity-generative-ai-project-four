This Repo is to demonstrate my attempt at the HomeMatch Project: Personalized Real Estate Agent.

Here i demonstrate how to use LanChain Prompts, llms, chat history and chain them all together.

The app is supposed to demonstrate a chatbot/agent that builds up an idea of the users preferences when looking for house listings.

It then finds the most releavant listings (using a vector db) to the user and tailors there description to further captivate them.
